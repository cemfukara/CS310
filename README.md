# PROMISE

**Description**

Promise is a mobile application designed to help users organize their schedules and collaborate with friends. In addition to managing personal plans, users can “promise” each other to complete shared tasks and track one another’s progress. The app includes a point-based reward system that allows users to strengthen their in-game relationships and unlock fun features as they stay consistent with their commitments.

**Main Purpose — Problem the App Solves**

Many people experience stress from managing numerous tasks and often struggle to coordinate activities that involve multiple participants. Promise provides an intuitive, easy-to-use platform for planning both individual and shared tasks.

The app motivates users by sending notifications when their friends complete common goals, reinforcing a sense of teamwork and accountability. To make the experience more engaging, a point system allows users to unlock virtual mascots and develop their in-app relationships through continued collaboration.
